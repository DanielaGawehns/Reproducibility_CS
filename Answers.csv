"56","To me, in general, ""Reproducible Research"" is when the approach used in the research is followed on the same materials and in the same condition, we should get the results achieved by the research. 
In the context of computer science, the work should have released the associated code (i.e. their approach/method) along with the details used to run the code (e.g. in machine learning, hyperparameter values) and if possible, the work should reported results on a public benchmark dataset. When we run their code in these aforementioned conditions, we should achieve the same results reported in their work.","1","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","This might come in the materials or code, but still I thought might be interesting to mention:
