# DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

## Data File Description: 
The data provided for this project provides definition tables of the items (compounds and steroid hormones) that were used for this experiment. In addition it provides all the the concentration levels of the compounds and hormones that have been measured with the two techniques used for the experiments: the MTT assay and the LC-MS/MS analysis. 

## Survey List of Questions and Answer Possibilities
Open Text Box:What is your first association when you hear the term "Reproducible Research"? Please write your reply below
Q1 Here is a list of research practices for reproducible research, which ones are the most important ones? Please pick your top three.

Q2 Here is a list of research practices for reproducible research. Which ones do you implement in your daily work as a researcher? Please pick all research practices that you used/implemented since the beginning of the year. 
Q2-Open Text Box: This list is not complete, you should add the following good practice for reproducible research:
Q3 Let's turn the previous thought around and think about how to make things less reproducible: Here is a list of things you can fo to make your work as non-reproducible as possible. Which are the three most impactful actions to take if you want to make your work as least reproducible as possible? 
Q3-Open Text Box: I think this is even more impactful to make my work as least reproducible as possible:
Sliders: We would like to know which field of Computer Science you work in and which methods you use in your work. Use the slider to position yourself along the continuum based on how much you agree with a particular extreme label.
Sliders-Open Text Box: I work in the following subfield of computer science
